# Cracking
Cracking &amp; Hashcat related materials

## Notes
This repository and this file will be completed and updated as soon as i 
get more time

## Description
This repository contains partial r√©sulta from my last cracking session 
against more than 9 000 000 MD5 hashes extracted from multiple public leaks 
and various other coming from various sources. My main goal was to be able 
to recover more than 60% of the plain text passwords, which was a success 
as i finally was able to recover more than 87% of them. I ran basic 
analysis against my results and tought it would probably be usefull to 
someone .

## GPU
I currently use a Gigabyte GTX 1080 XTreme Gaming Edition (Non 
watercooling) a little bit overclocked, under Fedora Workstation 30 64 bits 
I used hashcat, PACK, pipal, hatecrack and made various scripts which may 
will come later on this repository.
